1 - Get data by bodyType (moon) from the Solar System API.

2 - In the same component, implement dynamic wikipedia URLs to get the thumbnail image of each object:

        2.1 - Based on the response array, add a forEach loop to extract the englishName value of each object.
        Build the dynamic Wikipedia URL in a new array using map() js.
        Make a new request on the Wikipedia API using promise.all to retrieve the thumbnails url of each object.

        TODO: handle use case when there are no image associated with the object and find out if its bc there is none or if its bc of the custom name we've made with the addition of ' (moon)'.

        2.2 - In the last .then, build a new array of object with the original name the custom name and the thumbnail url to set in local state.

        2.3 In the JSX part of the component, use of local state to then display the result using map() JS.

3 - Display the original name as well as the custom name associated to each image.
